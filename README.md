I got my first 3D printer when I was a student. It was Ender 3 Pro (year 2018).

I upgraded many parts. 
- Upgraded: Mainboard 8 bit to 32 bit with slince drivers
- Upgraded: Upgraded to glass bed
- Upgraded: To full size SD card with adaptor
- Added a Auto Leveling Sensor for bed leveling
- Added IOT relay to turn it off.
- Added A switch for power shutdown (connected to relay module)
- Added a IOT Camera
  
Note: Octorprint was popular that time but I just a use simple IOT Cam because it was more cheaper and easy.
- Changed many nozzles and 2 times the heater block, 1 time POM Bearings.

  I used it a lot , for so many projects.

Play with it, printered hours for large parts. Change broken parts , got many failed prints , edited G codes, upgraded many parts. 

In short I had fun with it , I love 3D printing,

Now, I had a job and dont have time to deal with all those things. So I use Bambulab X1-Carbon now.

Note: Highly recommended.


I know SLA printers coming more popular because of their decent print quality.

But those are so messy , and time consuming so I do not plan to use them soon.

I just order from JLCPCB if need a part that reqires SLA printer.
